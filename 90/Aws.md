Here is a **practical, low-risk, high-impact strategy** to approach him — especially since the connection is light (LinkedIn-only), and you don’t want to come across as pushy or as someone asking for a job directly.

Below is a **step-by-step approach**, sample messages, and specific things to **say at the AWS event** to make the conversation natural and valuable for both sides.

---

# ✅ **1. Your Current Situation**

* You know an MD at PwC leading Cloud Transformation
* You're meeting him at an AWS event next week
* You want to build a relationship that could later help you get a job
* You’re still completing **CKA, AWS SA Pro, DevOps Pro**

➡️ **This is completely fine.**
Senior leaders do *not* expect you to have every certification.
They look for:

* attitude
* clarity
* initiative
* relevance
* value you can bring

---

# ✅ **2. Your Goal**

Your goal at the event is NOT to ask for a job.

Your real goal is:
**Get him to remember you positively → build rapport → get permission to follow up → open the door later.**

---

# ✅ **3. What NOT to do**

❌ Don’t say: “Sir, I’m looking for a job at PwC, can you refer me?”
❌ Don’t ask him to check your resume
❌ Don’t talk too much about your certifications gap
❌ Don’t come across as nervous or needy
❌ Don’t immediately send him your CV after the event

These are instant turn-offs for senior leaders.

# ✅ **4. What TO do instead: The “Soft Power Approach”**

## **Step 1 — Start with appreciation**

Just one sentence. Short. Clean.

**Example:**
“Hi <Name>, great to see you here. I’ve been following your work in cloud transformation at PwC — very inspiring.”

This is polite and professional and does not feel like flattery.

---

## **Step 2 — Add a micro-context about yourself (10 seconds max)**

Something like:

“I'm currently working on building deeper expertise in Kubernetes and AWS architecture. Preparing for SA Pro and CKA as well.”

Why this works:

* It positions you as **serious and improving**
* Shows you’re on the right path (AWS/K8s)
* Doesn’t highlight what you *don’t* have yet
* Gives him something to talk about

---

## **Step 3 — Ask ONE smart question (this creates connection)**

MDs love being asked strategic questions, not certification questions.

Example questions:

**Option A — Strategy question (very effective):**
“What do you feel is the biggest challenge enterprises face in cloud transformation today — talent, architecture, or culture?”

**Option B — Future-looking question:**
“How do you see GenAI and cloud-native intersecting in the next 2–3 years at enterprise scale?”

**Option C — Leadership question:**
“What skills do you value most in engineers joining cloud transformation programs today?”

These questions:

* Make you look thoughtful
* Make him talk (people remember those who listen to them)
* Create a deeper conversation compared to “How can I get a job?”

---

## **Step 4 — Close the conversation professionally**

After 2–3 minutes, you end it gracefully:

“Would love to stay connected — I’m working toward specialist roles in cloud/AI. If you don’t mind, I’ll reach out on LinkedIn once my SA Pro is completed for some guidance.”

He will almost always say: “Sure, please do.”

➡️ Now you have permission to follow up.

This is GOLD.

---

# ✅ **5. What to do AFTER the event**

Send a simple message:

**LinkedIn message example:**

> *Hi <Name>, great meeting you at the AWS event today.
> I really liked your point about <repeat something he said>.
> As discussed, I’m progressing with SA Pro + CKA.
> Would love to seek your guidance once I finish them.
> Thanks again for your time — truly appreciated.”*

Notice:
✓ No mention of job
✓ No resume
✓ Respectful
✓ Shows growth

Later, once you complete a cert or project, you message again.

After 2–3 interactions, **he becomes a warm contact**, and THEN you can ask:

> “If there’s any cloud transformation role at PwC that aligns with my profile, I would love your guidance on how to apply.”

This is the safe + smart way.

# 🎯 **6. Important psychological insight**

Senior leaders respond positively to:

✔ Curiosity
✔ Professionalism
✔ Respect
✔ Initiative
✔ Growth

They DO NOT respond well to:

❌ Direct job requests
❌ Long CV stories
❌ Nervous chatter
❌ Over-compliments

Your goal is to appear as:

**“Someone serious, improving, technically strong, and worth remembering.”**

---

# 🧠 Want me to prepare:

✓ A *script* for your 30–60 second conversation?
✓ A *LinkedIn follow-up message* template?
✓ A *resume pitch line* for when he asks “What do you do?”
✓ A *conversation opener based on AWS Hero topics*?

Just tell me — I’ll prepare it perfectly for you.
