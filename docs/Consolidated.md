## 💡 3. Prompt Engineering Framework for Effective Development

You can structure your prompts to get the *best code output* and repeatable results.
Here’s a pattern:

### 🔹 Prompt Template 1 — *Code Generation*

```
You are a senior KYC domain developer.
Generate Python code to extract key fields (Name, PAN, DOB, Address)
from a scanned KYC document (PDF or image) using OCR.
Validate PAN format and DOB > 18 years.
Output JSON in standard format and include unit tests.
```

### 🔹 Prompt Template 2 — *Refactoring & Optimization*

```
You are an enterprise-grade code reviewer.
Optimize the below KYC validation code for scalability and readability.
Add logging, exception handling, and docstrings.
```

### 🔹 Prompt Template 3 — *Explain + Generate Docs*

```
Explain this AML screening script in plain English for a compliance officer.
Generate an accompanying README summarizing workflow and data flow.
```

### 🔹 Prompt Template 4 — *End-to-End Workflow Creation*

```
Build a complete automation script that:
1. Reads KYC customer data from CSV.
2. Validates mandatory fields.
3. Runs sanctions screening API.
4. Generates an Excel report with risk category.
Use pandas and requests library. Add comments.
```

### 🔹 Prompt Template 5 — *Test & QA*

```
Generate 10 positive and negative test cases for KYC data validation logic.
Cover missing PAN, invalid DOB, and incomplete address.
```

Would you like me to create **3 detailed POC blueprints** (architecture + prompt + sample code + expected output) that you can directly implement with Gemini CodeAssist in your bank setup?
I can tailor them for your KYC microservice (e.g., document parser, sanctions screening, and expiry alert bot).

---

### **User:**

Can you tell me what other banks like JP Morgan Chase, HSBC, UBS, they are using CodeAssist with KYC? Because we already have a Google Code POC, with doc ai and OCR for document verification and all those parts. Not sure all these use cases which you suggested I can develop or may be already developed. Please tell me latest trends and high impact areas in this domain and may be can I develop something using blockchain technology here too

### **User:**

I have heard in internet discussion as well as in some forums that industry is moving to Auto KYC. Right now we have hundreds of people who are doing scanning of the document, creating the company structure for the company KYC. As well as for individuals they do 2 eye, 4 eye and , 6 eye checks. They are makers and checkers. And it's 95% file processing with no error. So, on those lines, if I can provide some solution, if you suggest.

### **User:**

This is a country-specific, but this is not country-specific. So, PANcard, Aadhaar Card, these are just for India. Our bank works across 30 countries, and that's Europe, US, UK, Japan, India, and other countries. So, you need to see what all kind of documents come, we already do that. Plus, there is a company called LexisNexis, which are being accepted in banks as a golden source. Can we build something like that in our KYC, which other banks and other institutes can use from our bank's data? Means a product people utilize across industry
