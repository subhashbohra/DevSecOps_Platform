# üìù **AI DevSecOps Platform ‚Äì Product Description for Code Generation**

## **Product Goal**

Build an **AI-powered DevSecOps platform** that integrates with **GitHub Enterprise**. The tool performs static code analysis, vulnerability scanning, dependency updates, AI-assisted PR reviews, and auto-fixes. It unifies capabilities of SonarQube, Veracode, JFrog Xray, RenovateBot, Dependabot, and CodeQL into a **single product**.

---

## **Core MVP Features (Phase 1)**

1. **Installation & Setup**

   * GitHub App installation across all repos in a GitHub Enterprise organization (landing zone).
   * Configurable YAML policies stored in a central repo (`.devsecops/config.yml`).

2. **Dependency Scanning & Updates**

   * Parse manifests (`package.json`, `pom.xml`, `requirements.txt`, etc.).
   * Check for outdated and vulnerable dependencies using **internal Artifactory/Nexus** + public registries.
   * Suggest safe upgrades with **merge confidence scoring**.

3. **Unified PR Auto-Fix**

   * Raise one PR per repo with:

     * Dependency bumps.
     * Vulnerability patches.
     * Inline AI explanations.
   * PR dashboard includes: security badge, vulnerability summary, dependency graph snapshot.

4. **AI-Driven PR Review Comments**

   * Copilot-style inline suggestions.
   * AI explains ‚Äúwhy‚Äù the issue exists and ‚Äúhow‚Äù to fix it.

---

## **Extended Features (Phase 2 & 3)**

* **Static Code Analysis (SAST)**: Use CodeQL/Semgrep to detect code smells and vulnerabilities.
* **Software Composition Analysis (SCA)**: Transitive + manifest-level vulnerability scanning.
* **Secrets Detection**: Scan repos for API keys, passwords, tokens.
* **Container & IaC Scanning**: Dockerfiles, Kubernetes, Terraform.
* **License Compliance**: Detect incompatible OSS licenses.
* **SBOM Generation**: Generate SBOM in SPDX or CycloneDX format.
* **Threat Modeling**: AI-generated OWASP/STRIDE models for each repo.
* **Test Coverage Insights**: Detect weak test coverage, generate missing tests.
* **Cross-Repo Dependency Graph**: Visualize org-wide dependencies and risks.

---

## **AI Layer Requirements**

* Use **LLMs (OpenAI GPT-4, AWS Bedrock Claude, Anthropic)** for:

  * Explaining vulnerabilities and fixes in plain English.
  * Generating PR review comments.
  * Suggesting refactorings and secure patterns.
* Responses should be **developer-educational**, not just descriptive.

---

## **Architecture Blueprint**

1. **GitHub Integration**:

   * GitHub App + GitHub Actions for repo triggers.
   * Webhooks for PRs, merges, and pushes.

2. **Scanning Engines**:

   * SAST: CodeQL, Semgrep.
   * SCA: Trivy, Grype, OSS Index, GitHub Advisory DB.
   * Container/IaC: Trivy, Checkov.
   * Secrets: GitLeaks.

3. **Data & Storage**:

   * Postgres/DynamoDB for scan results.
   * Object storage (S3/Blob) for reports.

4. **AI Orchestration**:

   * LLM prompt layer wraps scan outputs.
   * Generates explanations, auto-fixes, PR comments.

5. **Dashboard & Reporting**:

   * In-PR summary comments + Markdown tables.
   * Org-wide web dashboard (React + Node backend).

---

## **Deliverables**

* GitHub Action workflows (YAML) for scanning, PR creation, and dashboards.
* Node.js/Python backend for orchestrating scans.
* AI integration layer (API calls to LLMs).
* React-based web dashboard for org-level reports.
* CLI tool for local developer use.

---

## **Acceptance Criteria**

1. After installation, all repos in org are auto-discovered.
2. Running the workflow scans dependencies, vulnerabilities, and code.
3. A PR is raised with:

   * Fixed vulnerabilities.
   * Updated dependencies.
   * Inline AI code review comments.
   * Markdown dashboard inside PR.
4. Reports are stored centrally and accessible via a web UI.

üëâ With this description, Codex (or any AI code generator) can scaffold:

* GitHub Actions workflows,
* dependency scanning scripts,
* AI PR bot logic,
* and even the React dashboard skeleton.
