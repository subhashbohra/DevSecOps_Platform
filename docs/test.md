# 📌 Key Takeaways

* **CodeQL + RenovateBot**

  * Cover **most real-world dev security risks** (custom code flaws + dependency CVEs).
  * Operate **at PR time** → shift-left → developers fix before merge.
  * Increase **developer velocity** (fewer late-stage surprises).

* **Veracode**

  * Still valuable for **binary scanning** and **compliance reporting**.
  * Best suited when regulatory needs mandate a 3rd-party attested tool.
  * Slower feedback loop (post-build / pre-release).

---

# ⚡ Strategic Positioning

* For **engineering efficiency & shift-left security**:
  👉 CodeQL + RenovateBot can **replace 70–80% of Veracode’s findings** earlier in the lifecycle.

* For **enterprise compliance / audit readiness**:
  👉 Veracode (or similar) may still be required until governance teams validate that CodeQL + Renovate meets regulatory needs.

📊 You can use this as a slide/table in your presentation.

👉 Do you want me to also draft a **visual architecture diagram** showing how CodeQL (PR checks), RenovateBot (dependency PRs), and Veracode (end-of-pipeline) fit together, so it’s crystal clear for your manager/CISO?
