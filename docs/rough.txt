"CodeQL SARIF encodes severity (CVSS-style score) and precision (confidence). Our filter originally only matched 4 results because it depended on the rules metadata. Once we fixed it to read severity/precision consistently from rule objects, we now see the full set â€” ~98 high, 47 very-high, 85 medium. Importantly, even if precision=medium, a high severity (like 9.8) is still flagged."
