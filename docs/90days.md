You’re thinking clearly — and yes, your plan makes sense.
If the rating is likely to be bad and trust is broken, **preparing to move is the smart play**. Let’s make this a focused 3-month execution plan so you don’t waste time or burn out.

---

## 1. Reality Check (and Why Your Plan Is Strong)

You’re already aiming for:

* ✅ **CKA (Certified Kubernetes Administrator)**
* ✅ **AWS Solutions Architect – Professional**
* ✅ **AWS DevOps Engineer – Professional**

That’s a **very strong DevOps / Cloud profile** when combined with real experience.

But here’s the truth:

* Certifications **alone don’t get offers**
* Certs + **strong project narratives** = interview calls

So we’ll balance:
**Certs (credibility)** + **Job Search Prep (visibility)**

---

## 2. 90-Day Acceleration Plan

### Month 1 (Weeks 1–4): Foundation + First Certification

**Target**: Finish **CKA first**

Why:

* Fastest to prepare
* Highly valued for DevOps/K8s roles

Daily plan (2–3 hrs on weekdays, more on weekends):

* Kubernetes architecture
* Pods, Deployments, Services
* ConfigMaps, Secrets
* Volumes & Storage
* Networking
* RBAC
* Troubleshooting

By end of Month 1:
✅ Attempt **CKA exam**

At the same time:

* Start drafting strong bullet points for your resume

---

### Month 2 (Weeks 5–8): AWS SA Pro + Job Search Warm-up

Start:

* AWS advanced networking
* Hybrid connectivity
* Cost optimization
* Multi-account strategies
* Disaster recovery
* Well-Architected Framework

Also start:
✅ Creating/optimizing **LinkedIn**
✅ Drafting **2 versions of your resume**

* One for DevOps roles
* One for Cloud Architect/SRE roles

By end of Month 2:
✅ Actively applying to 5–10 jobs/week

---

### Month 3 (Weeks 9–12): AWS DevOps Pro + Aggressive Job Search

Focus on:

* CI/CD (CodePipeline, GitHub Actions, Jenkins)
* CloudFormation / Terraform
* Observability
* Blue/Green & Canary deployments
* Chaos engineering basics

Now increase:
✅ Applications to 15–20/week
✅ Recruiter networking
✅ Mock interviews

---

## 3. What You Should Do *Immediately* (This Week)

This is critical — don’t wait till exams are done.

### 1. Start documenting your projects

Use this format:

**Project Name**
Tech used: AWS, Kubernetes, Terraform, Jenkins, etc
What you solved: (technical + business)
Scale: (users, traffic, cost, uptime, latency)
Result: (metrics)

This becomes interview gold.

---

### 2. Quietly start job search now

You don’t need all certs to start.

This week:

* Update LinkedIn headline:

  > DevOps Engineer | Kubernetes | AWS | Terraform | CI/CD

* Turn on recruiter visibility.

* Start connecting with:

  * DevOps Managers
  * SREs
  * Recruiters

---

## 4. Smart Exam Order (to maximize speed)

Here’s the optimal path if time is tight:

1️⃣ **CKA (30–45 days)**
2️⃣ **AWS DevOps Pro**
3️⃣ **AWS SA Pro**

Why?
AWS DevOps Pro is more hands-on and aligns better with your experience.

If timeline pressure increases, we can compress.

---

## 5. Interview Readiness Path

You should start preparing answers to:

* “Tell me about a production outage you handled”
* “How do you design scalable, fault-tolerant systems?”
* “How do you optimize cloud cost?”
* “How do you secure Kubernetes clusters?”

I can help you rehearse answers.

---

## 6. Backup Strategy

If current company becomes toxic:

* Stop emotional investment
* Deliver what’s required
* Channel energy into **certs + prep + job search**

---

## 7. I can help you build:

Tell me:

* Years of experience?
* Current role title?
* Key tech stack?

I’ll help you:
✅ Create a tight resume
✅ Make a 12-week study plan
✅ Draft LinkedIn profile
✅ Simulate DevOps interview questions

You’re doing the right thing by taking control of your path.
Let’s make this a disciplined, focused “reset and relaunch.”
