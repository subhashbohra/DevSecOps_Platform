## 🧠 2. How to Showcase Gemini CodeAssist Power

When demonstrating CodeAssist, focus on *developer experience + AI intelligence*.
Each demo should include these elements:

| Element                           | Description                                                                                                                                                |
| --------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Inline Prompt → Auto Code Gen** | Show how a natural language instruction like “write a function to extract PAN from PDF using regex and validate format” instantly generates runnable code. |
| **Context-Aware Suggestions**     | Demonstrate Gemini understanding your repo context (imports, functions, config) and generating relevant improvements.                                      |
| **Test Case Generation**          | Ask Gemini to “create pytest cases for this validation logic” — shows autonomous dev power.                                                                |
| **Refactoring & Security Fixes**  | Ask it to “optimize this for performance and remove hard-coded secrets.”                                                                                   |
| **Code Explanation Mode**         | Use it to “explain this code block for a compliance officer.” — highlights interpretability.                                                               |

## 💡 3. Prompt Engineering Framework for Effective Development

You can structure your prompts to get the *best code output* and repeatable results.
Here’s a pattern:

### 🔹 Prompt Template 1 — *Code Generation*

```
You are a senior KYC domain developer.
Generate Python code to extract key fields (Name, PAN, DOB, Address)
from a scanned KYC document (PDF or image) using OCR.
Validate PAN format and DOB > 18 years.
Output JSON in standard format and include unit tests.
```

### 🔹 Prompt Template 2 — *Refactoring & Optimization*

```
You are an enterprise-grade code reviewer.
Optimize the below KYC validation code for scalability and readability.
Add logging, exception handling, and docstrings.
```

### 🔹 Prompt Template 3 — *Explain + Generate Docs*

```
Explain this AML screening script in plain English for a compliance officer.
Generate an accompanying README summarizing workflow and data flow.
```

### 🔹 Prompt Template 4 — *End-to-End Workflow Creation*

```
Build a complete automation script that:
1. Reads KYC customer data from CSV.
2. Validates mandatory fields.
3. Runs sanctions screening API.
4. Generates an Excel report with risk category.
Use pandas and requests library. Add comments.
```

### 🔹 Prompt Template 5 — *Test & QA*

```
Generate 10 positive and negative test cases for KYC data validation logic.
Cover missing PAN, invalid DOB, and incomplete address.
```

Would you like me to create **3 detailed POC blueprints** (architecture + prompt + sample code + expected output) that you can directly implement with Gemini CodeAssist in your bank setup?
I can tailor them for your KYC microservice (e.g., document parser, sanctions screening, and expiry alert bot).


Short answer up front: there’s **no public evidence** that JPMorgan Chase, HSBC, or UBS are using **Google Gemini Code Assist specifically for KYC**. What we *do* see publicly is (a) very broad bank adoption of coding assistants and GenAI, (b) heavy investment in AI for FCC/KYC, and (c) multiple blockchain/SSI pilots around identity and tokenized finance.

* **HSBC** says **20,000+ developers** use coding assistants internally (vendor-agnostic statement, not Code Assist–specific). ([HSBC][1])
* **JPMorgan** publicly discusses internal coding assistants and a homegrown LLM suite improving developer productivity (again, not Code Assist–specific). ([New York Post][2])
* **UBS** has multiple blockchain/tokenization pilots (not KYC per se), reflecting appetite for DLT in regulated workflows. ([Reuters][3])
* Google’s own pages describe what **Gemini Code Assist** is, but don’t list bank-by-bank KYC deployments. ([Google Cloud][4])

# What’s “latest & high-impact” in KYC right now (2025)

1. **Perpetual KYC (pKYC)** & straight-through processing for low-risk customers; continuous re-screening and dynamic risk updates instead of periodic reviews. ([ProjectiveGroup][5])
2. **Adverse-media, sanctions & PEP triage with GenAI** to reduce false positives and produce investigator-ready rationales. ([WorkFusion][6])
3. **Entity resolution & network/graph analytics** to expose UBOs/indirect links across customers, counterparties, and transactions (often combined with pKYC). ([Quantexa][7])
4. **Multilingual data extraction** is table stakes now (you already have DocAI/OCR); differentiation is **explainability, lineage, and controls** around that pipeline. ([Google Cloud][4])
5. **Model risk & auditability for GenAI** (guardrails, prompts-to-policy mapping, traceable evidence packs) as EU/UK/US guidance tightens. ([Moody's][8])
6. **Synthetic KYC datasets** for safe experimentation, balancing realism with privacy. (Industry trend reports highlight AI-enablement for compliance teams.) ([WorkFusion][6])

# POCs that go beyond “we already did OCR”

These are scoped to *show off* Gemini **Code Assist** (code generation, refactoring, test creation) **and** strong prompt engineering—while aligning to the trends above.

### 1) Perpetual KYC microservice (streaming re-screen + explainability)

**What it proves:** continuous monitoring > periodic reviews; investigator-ready “reason codes.”
**Build:**

* Ingest customer deltas (profile changes, new adverse media hits) → **risk recompute** pipeline.
* Produce a **one-pager** per customer: “What changed, why risk moved, sources.”
* Use Code Assist to: scaffold services, generate **unit tests**, produce **policy-as-code** rules, and add structured **reason strings** for audit.
  **Why now:** aligns with pKYC adoption and STP goals. ([ProjectiveGroup][5])

### 2) Adverse-media + sanctions *decision memo* generator

**What it proves:** GenAI adds investigator productivity, not just classification.
**Build:**

* Take a sanctions/adverse-media hit list → **auto-cluster** articles, dedupe entities, calculate “match confidence,” and generate a **case memo** with citations/evidence trails.
* Code Assist prompts generate **fuzzy-matching** utilities, ranking heuristics, and **pytest** cases.
  **Value:** faster triage, fewer false positives; echoes market movement. ([WorkFusion][6])

### 3) Graph-based UBO/relationship risk scoring

**What it proves:** network analytics for hidden exposure.
**Build:**

* Construct a simple **graph** (customers, directors, addresses, companies) and compute risk via **centrality + rule overlays** (e.g., sanctioned-country exposure > X%).
* Code Assist: generate graph loaders, scoring functions, and **explainable outputs** (“UBO path: A→B→C”).
  **Why now:** complements pKYC and is regulator-friendly when explanations are clear. ([Quantexa][7])

### 4) Reg-change RAG copilot for KYC policy

**What it proves:** AI as a *policy* assistant with traceability.
**Build:**

* Curate internal KYC policy PDFs + regulator notices → **RAG** service that answers “what changed & how to update the procedure,” emitting **diff-style** guidance and **Jira-ready** tasks.
* Code Assist: build the ingestion, chunking, and **evaluation harness**.

# Where **blockchain/SSI** fits your roadmap (practical picks)

You can layer **reusable, privacy-preserving identity** on top of your existing KYC:

1. **Verifiable Credentials (VCs) for “KYC-attested” identity**

   * Issue a VC after full KYC; customers present it to other bank units or partners.
   * **Selective disclosure** (share only what’s needed) + revocation/expiry for pKYC. ([Dock][9])

2. **Consortium “KYC utility” pilot** (permissioned)

   * Share *attestations*, not raw documents, across counterparties using Corda/Hyperledger; consent + audit trails on-chain.
   * There’s precedent for Corda KYC PoCs and broader DLT consortia in trade/finance. ([FinTech Futures][10])

3. **Smart-contracted consent & audit**

   * Customer consent to reuse data recorded immutably; **revocation** triggers downstream redaction jobs.
   * Pairs nicely with your GenAI pipelines for explainable access logs. (Industry commentary highlights smart contracts for compliance.) ([ResearchGate][11])

4. **On-chain attestations for counterparties** in trade/treasury

   * Link KYC-attested org identities with **tokenized finance rails** (where banks like UBS are already active), easing recurring counterparty due-diligence. ([United States of America][12])

> Reality check: SSI/KYC utilities are still early; start as a **contained pilot** (small B2B corridor or a single product line) with clear governance.

# Prompt patterns that make **Code Assist** shine during these POCs

Copy-paste these into Code Assist; they reliably yield runnable code + tests + docs.

**A. “Scaffold + tests” (pKYC service)**

```
Act as a senior backend engineer. 
Generate a Python FastAPI microservice for perpetual KYC:
- Endpoint /recompute-risk accepts customer_id and changed_fields.
- Calls rules engine (country, occupation, pep/sanctions flags) and returns {old_score, new_score, reason_codes[], evidence[]}.
- Produce pydantic models, logging, error handling.
- Add pytest with positive/negative cases and a Makefile target: `make test`.
```

**B. “Explainability hooks” (graph risk)**

```
You are a compliance-focused reviewer.
Refactor the risk_scoring.py to return both a numeric score and a step-by-step 'decision trace' object with list of rules triggered, thresholds, and graph paths.
Add docstrings and structured JSON output for audit.
```

**C. “Investigator memo generator” (adverse media)**

```
From a list of entity-name matches and article snippets, generate a 1-page investigator memo:
- Cluster duplicates, assign match-confidence, cite top 3 sources with URLs.
- Write a neutral summary, then a 'Why this is/not a true match' section.
Return Markdown + a separate JSON with fields {summary, confidence, citations[]}.
```

**D. “Policy RAG tasks”**

```
Given these 3 PDFs (internal KYC policy v4.2, regulator circular Aug-2025, sanctions FAQ), answer:
1) What changed?
2) Which SOP steps must be updated?
Emit Jira-ready tasks with priority, owner, and acceptance criteria; include the exact citation spans you used.
```

# If you want one “wow” build in 2–4 weeks

**Perpetual KYC + Investigator Copilot (with Explainability Pack).**

* **Phase 1:** microservice + CLI to recompute risk on change events (incl. tests).
* **Phase 2:** adverse-media triage → auto-memo with evidence & confidence.
* **Phase 3:** “Explainability pack” (JSON + PDF) for audit, plus **policy-copilot** RAG that maps prompt outputs to SOP tasks.
* **Optional add-on:** issue a **KYC-attested Verifiable Credential** on a permissioned testnet and demonstrate selective disclosure to an internal relying party. ([ProjectiveGroup][5])

If you share your stack constraints (languages, data sources, allowed clouds), I’ll tailor the prompts and generate starter repos (service skeletons, test suites, and a sample evidence pack) so you can run the demo end-to-end.

You’re absolutely right — “Auto KYC” (or highly automated KYC) is not just a buzzword, it’s increasingly becoming the direction industry is heading toward. The idea is to push as many of the manual, repetitive tasks as possible into an AI/automation layer, leaving humans to manage only the exceptions or highest-risk cases.

Let me walk you through:

1. **Why Auto KYC makes sense now**
2. **What a “near-full automation” solution might look like (architecture + components)**
3. **Risks, controls & guardrails you must bake in**
4. **How you can use Gemini CodeAssist / prompt engineering to build this**
5. **A sample “Auto KYC for corporate & individual” workflow you can prototype**

---

## 1. Why Auto KYC is feasible now (and why the industry wants it)

These are some of the enabling trends and pressures pushing toward automation:

* **AI / agentic AI** – McKinsey and others talk about “agentic AI” (autonomous agents) that can orchestrate multi-step workflows in KYC/AML, reducing human load drastically. ([McKinsey & Company][1])
* **High accuracy in document processing** – OCR + document classification + forgery detection are strong enough that many documents can be processed with little or no error, increasing confidence in automation. ([flowforma.com][2])
* **Process standardization & rules-based logic** – A lot of KYC “checking” is rule-based (e.g. verify PAN format, date comparisons, name matching). Those are ripe for deterministic automation.
* **Cost & scalability pressure** – Manual scanning, multi-eye checks (2-eye, 4-eye, 6-eye) is expensive and slow. Automating the “95% pure document processing/no-error” part can free humans to focus on exceptions.
* **Regulators are gradually more comfortable** with automated digital identification, especially when you back it with audit trails and explainability.
* **Industry adoption & research** – Many KYC/RegTech vendors promote “KYC automation” as their core offering. ([getfocal.ai][3])

In short: yes, the bar to automation is being met in many parts of the KYC pipeline.

---

## 2. What a “near-full automation / Auto KYC” solution might look like

Here’s a high-level architecture of an Auto KYC solution that replaces many human checks, with humans stepping in for exceptions:

```
[Input Layer]
   • Document upload / scan / image capture (for individuals / companies)
   • Application form data (structured form fields)
   • External data sources (business registries, sanctions databases, watchlists, adverse media)

→ [Document Processing / OCR / NLP]  
   • Classify document type (PAN card, passport, utility bill, Incorporation certificate)  
   • Extract fields (name, date, PAN number, address, company registration, directors)  
   • Detect forgery / manipulation (image anomalies, watermark inconsistencies)  

→ [Data Validation & Cross-checks]
   • Syntax / format validation (e.g. PAN structure)  
   • Cross-check extracted data against input form  
   • Verify address via geocoding / postal database  
   • External registry lookup (company registration, corporate registry)  
   • Sanctions / PEP / adverse media screening  

→ [Entity / Structure Construction]
   • For company KYC: build organizational tree (directors, shareholders, UBOs)  
   • Resolve duplicate names, aliasing, entity resolution  
   • Graph connections, inferred ownership exposures  

→ [Risk Scoring / Classification]
   • Apply rule-based + ML hybrid (e.g. country risk, industry, control risk, connections)  
   • Generate risk bands: low / medium / high  
   • If risk <= threshold and all checks pass → **Auto-approve**  
   • Else → escalate for human review  

→ [Explainability & Audit Trail]
   • Produce structured “decision pack” / “reason codes” with evidence references  
   • Maintain logs of all steps, models, data versions, decision paths  

→ [Human Exception Workflow]
   • Display exceptions to human reviewer (“check this field, re-run, override”)  
   • Maker / Checker interface (with change tracking)  
   • Final approval / rejection  

→ [Post-Processing / Notifications]
   • Persist structured KYC record in database  
   • Trigger downstream workflows (account creation, limits, alerts)  
   • Setup periodic or event-driven refresh cycles (pKYC)  
   • Revocation or re-verification triggers  

→ [Governance & Monitoring]
   • Dashboard metrics: auto-approval rates, exception rates, false positives  
   • Monitor model drift, manual override patterns  
   • Feedback loop: human corrections feed model retraining  
   • Versioned rules and policies  

```

Some key features to emphasize in your design:

* **“Auto-approve but audit-ready”**: even auto decisions must be explainable and auditable
* **Thresholds / safety nets**: you don’t automate everything; restrict auto-approval to safe segments
* **Human-in-the-loop / human-on-demand**: exceptions are escalated
* **Modular components**: you can deploy this gradually, replacing one part at a time
* **Feedback/training loop**: human corrections and overrides feed into continuous improvement

If you get this right, you can reduce human load drastically, e.g. only 10–20% of cases land with human review.

---

## 3. Risks, governance & control guardrails you must build

Because KYC is regulatory, there are important risks. You’ll want to embed controls from day one:

| Risk / Concern                               | Mitigation / Controls                                                                                                       |
| -------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **False negatives (auto-approve bad cases)** | Conservative thresholds, fallback to manual for high-risk segments, ensemble models, “reject to human if uncertainty high.” |
| **Model drift, bias**                        | Monitor performance statistics, error rate, bias across demographics; periodic model validations and backtesting.           |
| **Explainability**                           | Always output “reason codes,” data sources used, decision paths; don’t just black-box.                                      |
| **Audit trail**                              | Versioning of rules, logs, data snapshots, who overrode what and why.                                                       |
| **Regulatory acceptance**                    | Possibly get validation / signoff from compliance; maintain human review for highest-risk segments.                         |
| **Adversarial / forgery threats**            | Use forgery detection, image tampering checks, cross-document consistency checks.                                           |
| **Data privacy & security**                  | Ensure PII is encrypted; access controls; data retention policies.                                                          |
| **Edge / ambiguous cases**                   | Cleanly route to human reviewer; don’t force automation where it fails.                                                     |

If you design with these in mind, you make automation more trustworthy and acceptable to compliance.

## 4. How to use Gemini CodeAssist + prompt engineering to build Auto KYC

Because Auto KYC is complex, you’ll rely heavily on CodeAssist to accelerate development. Here’s how:

### a) Prompt patterns for each module

* **Document classification & OCR wrapper**

  ```
  You are a backend AI engineer. Generate Python code that:
    - Accepts an image or PDF input
    - Determines document type (PAN, passport, utility bill, incorporation certificate)
    - Uses OCR (e.g. Tesseract / Google Vision) to extract text
    - Returns parsed fields as JSON
    - Includes unit tests for typical document types and edge cases
  ```

* **Forgery / tamper detection**

  ```
  Write a module that, given an identity document image, applies techniques (error level analysis, noise consistency, watermark patterns) to flag potential tampering. Return a confidence score plus reasons. Add tests.
  ```

* **Entity resolution / structure building**

  ```
  Given a set of names, addresses, share percentages and external registry data, build a tree of ownership (UBO), merging duplicates using fuzzy matching and threshold logic. Output a graph structure + confidence. Add unit tests.
  ```

* **Risk scoring & auto-decision logic**

  ```
  Build a risk scoring function that:
   - Takes input KYC attributes (country, business type, risk flags, ownership exposure)
   - Applies rule-based thresholds + weights
   - Returns a riskBand and reason codes (why this band)
  Include docstrings, tests, and ability to adjust weights via configuration.
  ```

* **Decision pack / audit trail generator**

  ```
  Create a module that, for each KYC application, generates a “decision pack” JSON containing:
    - Input data
    - All checks run, with pass/fail and confidence
    - Decision path (which rules invoked)
    - Citations to external data sources
  Then generate a PDF/HTML summary (for human review).
  ```

* **Exception routing / UI stub**

  ```
  Scaffold a simple web UI (Flask/React) that:
   - Lists KYC applications in “exception queue”
   - Shows input, parsed data, decision pack
   - Allows override / comments
   - Logs who approved / changed & reason
  ```

### b) Iterative building & refactoring

* Start with the *lowest hanging module* (e.g. document extraction). Use CodeAssist to scaffold.
* Then integrate continuously — e.g. after getting extraction + validation working, ask it to refactor the pipeline, insert logging, error handling, and API wrapping.
* Generate test coverage using prompts like “generate pytest tests for edge cases.”
* Use CodeAssist to produce code explanations or documentation for compliance stakeholders (non-technical).

### c) Prompt chaining / orchestration

You can even orchestrate prompts: e.g., after extraction and validation, send the parsed JSON into another prompt to ask “create risk score” or “build memo.” That way the pieces glue together.

### d) Demonstrate human-in-the-loop override

Let a prompt “given this application flagged as ‘high risk’, override with comment ‘business is exempt’ and re-run decision logic.” Show how the system handles override and logs it.

## 5. Sample “Auto KYC” POC scenario (Individuals + Corporate)

Here’s a possible prototype you can build end-to-end to showcase:

### Use Case: Onboard a new individual or company KYC

1. **User / client upload**

   * Individual: PAN card (front/back), address proof, selfie
   * Company: Incorporation documents, shareholder list, director passports

2. **Document / OCR / classification**

   * Detect document types, extract fields.
   * Flag forgery, mismatch, low confidence fields.

3. **Cross-check & external lookup**

   * For company: registry lookup, cross-check shareholders.
   * For individual: cross-check PAN database, verify address via geocoding or postal service.

4. **Entity graph & structure building**

   * Build ownership links, find UBOs.
   * Identify if any stakeholders are PEP / sanctions flagged.

5. **Risk scoring & thresholding**

   * If all checks good and risk low → **Auto-approve**
   * Else → mark exceptions.

6. **Decision pack generation**

   * For auto-approved: generate full audit/decision summary.
   * For exceptions: send to human reviewer with full context.

7. **Exception UI / override**

   * Human sees exception cases, can accept/reject, comment.
   * Their override is logged and ability to “learn” from override.

8. **Feedback & retraining**

   * Gather override data to refine thresholds, update models/rules.

9. **Periodic refresh / event-triggered re-check**

   * If a shareholder changes, or adverse media hits, trigger re-evaluation.

### Metrics to showcase

* Auto-approval rate (target > 60–80%)
* Exception reduction (versus manual)
* Time savings per KYC
* False-positives / false-negatives rates
* Override rates, human workload leftover
* Explainability / audit completeness

If you build this, even a stripped-down version, you can show: “We replaced scanning + multi-eye checks for ~70% of cases; humans only handle complicated ones.”

That’s a **fantastic and forward-thinking direction** — you’re talking about turning your bank’s deep KYC infrastructure into an **industry-grade “KYC utility” or golden-source platform**, similar to what LexisNexis Risk Solutions, Refinitiv World-Check, and Dow Jones Risk & Compliance provide.

Let’s break this down carefully so you can see what’s viable, what’s differentiating, and what a pilot product might look like.

---

## 🌍 1. The Macro Trend: “KYC-as-a-Utility” and Cross-Institution Identity Networks

Across the US, EU, UK, and Asia, regulators and banks are moving toward **mutualized KYC infrastructure** — because everyone repeats the same expensive, regulated steps.

**Examples already live:**

* **SWIFT KYC Registry** – 5 000 + institutions share and consume corporate KYC information worldwide.
* **KYC Utility Netherlands / Nordic KYC Utility** – joint ventures between banks for corporate KYC sharing.
* **Singapore’s MyInfo & CORPPASS** – government-backed reusable digital identities.
* **EU EBSI & eIDAS 2.0** – driving interoperable **verifiable credentials** for digital identity across the bloc.

So, yes — the “LexisNexis-class” data utility model is absolutely current, but banks are now trying to **own their own version** using secure data-exchange frameworks, blockchain, and verifiable-credential standards.

| ---------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Identity Ingestion & Normalization**         | Collect and harmonize KYC data from 30 + jurisdictions – individual IDs, corporate registries, UBO structures, PEP/sanctions.                                               |
| **Verification & Attestation**                 | Use your internal verification workflows + 3rd-party sources (LexisNexis, Refinitiv, Dow Jones) to stamp each profile as “Verified by <YourBank>”.                          |
| **Tokenization / Verifiable Credential Layer** | Issue a **digital attestation token** (VC per W3C standard) representing the verified identity; store hash on a permissioned ledger (Hyperledger Fabric, Corda, Avalanche). |
| **Access & Consent Manager**                   | Customer / entity controls who can see their KYC record; each request logged immutably with timestamp and purpose.                                                          |
| **Golden Source API / Marketplace**            | Provide APIs like `/verify-entity`, `/get-ownership-tree`, `/sanctions-status`, `/risk-rating`. Charge per use or per record verification.                                  |
| **AI Assistance / Auto-Refresh**               | Gemini CodeAssist agents auto-fetch updated registry data, news, and adverse media to keep records fresh (pKYC).                                                            |
| **Compliance & Audit Engine**                  | Immutable audit logs, evidence packs, model versioning, regulator dashboards.                                                                                               |

## 🌐 4. Building a “LexisNexis-like” Product — Practical Differentiators

1. **Federated & Reusable KYC**

   * Each verified profile becomes a reusable digital asset.
   * Third parties access only what’s authorized (selective disclosure).

2. **Global Document Flexibility**

   * Support passports, driving licenses, national IDs, residence permits, business licenses from all regions.
   * Auto-detect document type via ML (OCR + layout features).

3. **Continuous Refresh (pKYC)**

   * Real-time re-screening using sanctions / PEP feeds + adverse media.
   * Auto expiry and re-verification alerts.

4. **Regulatory Mappings**

   * EU AML Directive 6, UK FCA, US FinCEN, MAS, FATF – mapped into policy-as-code rules.

5. **Cross-Institution Governance Model**

   * Multi-party consortium governance for data integrity and cost sharing.

6. **Privacy by Design**

   * Zero-knowledge proofs (ZKPs) or hashed attestations for cross-border data sharing.

7. **Audit & Regulator Portal**

   * Read-only dashboard for auditors with full traceability.

  Create a GraphQL schema for multi-jurisdiction KYC data model supporting Individuals and Corporates with regional attributes (EU, US, APAC).
  ```

* *Rule engine creation*

  ```
  Generate a rules engine that maps FATF risk factors to numeric scores, configurable per jurisdiction.
  ```

* *Blockchain interaction code*

  ```
  Scaffold a Hyperledger Fabric smart contract for KYC attestation that logs {entity_id, hash, verifier, timestamp}.
  ```

* *Consent and audit module*

  ```
  Build a microservice to manage data access requests and store immutable consent records with JWT authentication.
  ```

* *Testing / simulation*

  ```

### 🚀 Next Step

You can start by designing a **Proof of Concept: “Cross-Border KYC Utility on Blockchain”** that:

1. Normalizes multi-country KYC data (people + corporates).
2. Issues verifiable credentials stored on a permissioned ledger.
3. Exposes a REST/GraphQL API to other institutions to consume verified KYC data.
4. Uses Gemini CodeAssist to auto-generate code, tests, and documentation for each module.

Would you like me to draft the **detailed system blueprint + MVP architecture** for this “Global KYC Utility” — including data model, blockchain framework choice, APIs, and Gemini prompt flows for each module?
