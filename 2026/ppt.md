## How to use this slide (important)

This slide is intentionally **single-page + metrics-first**, so you can:

* Drop **real DevLake screenshots** next to each bullet, or
* Keep it as a **talking slide** while opening DevLake dashboards live

---

## Exact DevLake widgets you should plug in (copy-paste for DevLake)

Below is the **exact widget mapping** I recommend so your leadership sees objective proof.

### 1️⃣ PR Cycle Time (Primary KPI)

**DevLake Widget**

* Metric: `PR Cycle Time`
* Aggregation: `Median + P75`
* Group by: `Repo` or `Org`
* Time range: `Before Copilot` vs `After Copilot`

**Leadership message**

> “Copilot reduces end-to-end PR turnaround by accelerating first-pass review.”

---

### 2️⃣ Time to First Review

**DevLake Widget**

* Metric: `Time to First Review`
* Filter: `PRs with Copilot Review`
* Aggregation: `Median`

**Leadership message**

> “Every PR now gets fast initial feedback, even before humans respond.”

---

### 3️⃣ PRs with Review Comments (% Coverage)

**DevLake Widget**

* Metric: `% PRs Reviewed`
* Filter: `Reviewer = Copilot OR Any`
* Breakdown: `By repo / team`

**Leadership message**

> “100% review coverage baseline achieved across repositories.”

---

### 4️⃣ Review Comment Density

**DevLake Widget**

* Metric: `Review Comments per PR`
* Aggregation: `Average`
* Compare: `With Copilot vs Without Copilot`

**Leadership message**

> “Higher signal per PR without increasing reviewer fatigue.”

---

### 5️⃣ Reopened PR Rate

**DevLake Widget**

* Metric: `% Reopened PRs`
* Compare: `Pre vs Post Copilot`

**Leadership message**

> “Better first-time review quality → fewer fix-and-reopen cycles.”

---

### 6️⃣ CI Failures After Review

**DevLake Widget**

* Metric: `CI Failure Rate After Review`
* Filter: `PRs Reviewed`
* Trend view

**Leadership message**

> “Issues are caught earlier, before pipelines fail.”

---

## How this sets up Phase-2 (key transition line)

Use this line verbatim in the meeting:

> “Phase-1 proves AI-assisted review consistency at scale.
> Phase-2 makes those reviews **architecture-aware and policy-enforcing** using Copilot customization.”

---

## Why this slide works for leadership

* ✅ One page
* ✅ Metrics-driven (DevLake, not opinions)
* ✅ Clear Phase-1 value
* ✅ Natural justification for Phase-2 investment

---

### Next (optional, I can do fast)

* Replace bullets with **actual DevLake screenshots** (layout optimized)
* Add a **Phase-1 → Phase-2 comparison slide**
* Create a **Copilot ROI slide** (cost vs saved reviewer hours)

Just tell me 👍
